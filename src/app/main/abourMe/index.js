                            If there is something I hate more than self-praise, it is falling into cliché or hackneyed phrases. However, just because of this, 
                            things do not stop being true, that is why it is with some annoyance that if I had to choose a word to describe myself it would be
                            "passionate". The passion and inclination to give my best covers every aspect of my life, from the simplest tasks, such as changing
                            a light bulb or mounting a shelf, to more complex ones such as programming. This passion is constantly fueled by the very nature of
                            the discipline: there is always something new to learn and work alone constantly motivates you to want to improve.

                        <br />
                        <p>
                            My interest in programming was sparked eight years ago, when I was 16, when I saw an advertisement for a video game development
                            course. At that time I attended a very demanding school and I had very little time left for anything else. Even so, the proposal
                            seduced me and I decided to give it a try.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            I finished the course and for a couple of years it was a hobby that I couldn't share with anyone. I used to develop small games in
                            c++ and c# but I never considered that programming would have this future or that it could become my profession. Time passed and so
                            the interest was deposited in other things, I began to write short articles for a small local newspaper, I learned to play piano and
                            drums and I had almost forgotten about programming
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            A couple of years ago, a bar conversation with a friend revived my passion and curiosity for technology, I decided to give it
                            another chance and it was then that I definitely decided and chose software development as my profession.

                        <br />
                        <p>
                            I love reading and cooking. I make bread, pizza, prepare a Thai or Mexican meal. I love to cook, is my unplug. The intellect is
                            applied to such a different place.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            I like to read mainly science and historical fiction, mystery and popular science. Among my favorite authors are Frank Herbert,
                            George Orwell, Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, Umberto Eco, Jorge Luis Borges and José Saramago (that selection was more difficult
                            than it seems)
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>I love Rock in general and David Bowie in particular. I also like Bob Dylan, The Doors and Pixies, among others</p>
