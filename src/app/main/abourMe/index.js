                    If there is something I hate more than self-praise, it is
                    falling into clich√© or hackneyed phrases. However, this does
                    not mean that something ceases to be true, therefore, it is
                    with some discomfort that if I had to choose a word to
                    describe myself it would be "passionate"; The passion and
                    inclination to give my best covers every aspect of my life,
                    from the simplest tasks, such as changing a light bulb or
                    mounting a shelf, to more complex tasks such as programming.
                    This passion is constantly fueled by the very nature of the
                    discipline: there is always something new to learn and work
                    alone constantly motivates you to want to improve.

                <p>
                    My interest in programming was sparked eight years ago, when
                    I was 16, when I saw an advertisement for a video game
                    development course. At that time I attended a very demanding
                    school and between it, musical studies, physical activity
                    and the rest of my activities I had very little time left
                    for anything else. Even so, the proposal seduced me and I
                    decided to give it a try.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I finished the course and for a couple of years it was a
                    hobby that I couldn't share with anyone. I used to develop
                    small games in c++ and c# but I never considered that
                    programming would have this future or that it could become
                    my profession.
